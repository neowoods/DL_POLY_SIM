#Understanding the derivatives


# SYSTEM & ENSEMBLE
temperature     		#Unit:Kelvin
pressure           		#Unit:K-atmosphere
ensemble


# RESTART OPTIONS 
restart  			#restart job from end point of previous run (i.e. continue current simulation, 
				REVOLD required)
dump  n				#set restart data dump interval to n steps (default n = 1000)


# SUMULATION & EQUILIBRATION 
step	n               	#run simulation for n timesteps (default n = 0, corresponding to a ”dry” run)
timestep  f			#set timestep to f ps variable
equilibration steps n		#equilibrate system for the first n timesteps (default n = 0)

scale  temperature every n	#rescale system temperature every n steps (default n = 1) during equilibration 
				(with respect to the last equilibration step - atomic velocities are scaled co
				-llectively), N.B. any thermostat and barostat memory is also erased


# SYSTEM CUTOFFS
rcut	f			#set required long-ranged interactions cutoff, rcut, to f Angstrom	
rvdw	f			#set required short-ranged interactions cutoff to f Angstrom	 
rpad	f			#set optional padding to the major cutoff, rcut, to f ˚A (f ≥ Min[0.05, 0.5%.rcut],
				 default f = 0)



# SYSTEM ELECTROSTATICS



# OUTPUT
print 	every n			#print system data every n timesteps print


# STATISTICS
collect				#include equilibration data in overall statistics
stats	every n			#accumulate statistics data every n timesteps
stack	size  n	     		#set rolling average stack to n timesteps


# HISTORY
replay history			#abort simulation and replay HISTORY to recalculate structural properties such
				 as RDFs, z-density profiles, defects and displacements trajectories (execution
				 halts if no property is specified
trajectory	i  j  k		#write HISTORY file with controls: 
				i = start timestep for dumping configurations (default i = 0)
				j = timestep interval between configurations (default j = 1) 
				k = data level (default k = 0)


# RDF
rdf sampling every f		#calculate and collect radial distribution functions every f timesteps (default f = 1)
print rdf 






# EXECUTION TIME 
job time   f			#set the walltime for a job to f seconds
close time    f			#set the amount of time a job has to finalise I/O to f seconds (this must be smaller 
				than the time specified by job time, see Further Comments on the CONTROL File notes)


# FINISH 
finish				#close the CONTROL file (last data record)
